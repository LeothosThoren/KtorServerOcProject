# KtorServerOcProject

###Description

OpenClassrooms gives you the heavy task of migrating all their server infrastructure ... in Kotlin! ^^

The first step of this migration will be the realization of a demonstration web application so that the CTO of OpenClassrooms can judge the feasibility of the future project. Thus, you will have to create an API in Kotlin that will return the information of a course in JSON format.
